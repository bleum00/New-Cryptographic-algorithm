# New-Cryptographic-algorithm
Created a sophisticated multi-layered encryption algorithm that integrates the Playfair Cipher,  binary conversion, and XOR operations. Plaintext is first encrypted using Playfair rules, then  converted to binary based on ASCII values, and finally secured with a secret binary key through  the XOR method.
